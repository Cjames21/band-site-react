This is the project folder for the front end of this web project. As of right now,
the files will only be updating in the front end branch of the git repo.

The band site project is being built to allow for a modern, affordable option
for local musicians looking to have their own web presence by providing an
easily customizable template to put their band on.

The MVP(Minimum Viable Product) will consist of the Home page, the About page,
and the Music page. As the back end is not yet completed, there will be no commerce
features until the appropriate code/tests are completed.

The front end will be running on the following technologies:
    - The usual front end stack(HTML5, CSS3, Javascript)
    - Stripped down Foundation6 (only need foundation.min.css for the grid features,
        as well as the topbar class)
        ** PORT SITE TO CSS GRID, LESS FRAMEWORKS IS BETTER **
    - React
        - React allows for me to create amazing, feature rich web applications that
          feel good to use. It comes with plenty of documentation, a great community,
          and an endless supply of plugins if needed.
        - React is being used for its powerful component based system, allowing
          me to focus on fleshing out the custom parts of the website that much more.
        - React uses the following dependencies:
          - react, react-dom, react-scripts, webpack, babel(I think),
